# CPEN-221-Coursework
A collection of the Java Mini-Projects README files done as part of the CPEN 221 Principles of Software Construction and text files describing my contributions for each project. These were written by the CPEN 221 Instructional Team and detail each project's background. To uphold academic integrity, the original repositories are left private. Please contact christopherchang150@gmail.com for more information.
